This program takes a search query from the user and compiles the textual information of all the webpages that appear on the first page of the SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages). Then it understands the the information in the compiled text as a human would, and summarizes it in short.

## Background
When making a search on Google or any other search engine, we often find that the information is fragmented and spread across many different webpages. Or we may find ourselves in a situation where after reading through a whole web page we realize that it did not have the content we are looking for. Thus having a solution that automatically compiled different webpages and summarizes them would reduce human effort and save time, while filtering out filler text, ads and other irrelevant tokens from the actual information.
